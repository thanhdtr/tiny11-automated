## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11** (PowerShell 5.1+)
- **Administrator privileges** (required for DISM operations)
- **30GB+ free disk space** (for builds)
- **Git** for version control
- **Valid Windows 11 ISO** for testing

### Fork & Clone

# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tiny11-automated.git
cd tiny11-automated
```

### Set Up Development Environment

```powershell

### Build Variants

1. **Tiny11 Standard** - Removes bloatware, keeps serviceability
2. **Tiny11 Core** - Ultra-minimal, WinSxS cleaned, non-serviceable
3. **Nano11** - EXTREME minimal, drivers/fonts removed, VM-only

### Automation Flow

```
1. GitHub Actions trigger (manual/scheduled)
   ↓
2. Download Windows 11 ISO
   ↓
3. Verify ISO checksum
   ↓
4. Mount ISO and extract
   ↓
5. Remove bloatware/packages
   ↓
6. Apply registry tweaks
   ↓
7. Optimize and compress
   ↓
8. Generate new ISO
   ↓
9. Create checksums (SHA256, MD5, SHA512)
   ↓

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code only
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/your-feature` - Your feature branch
- `hotfix/issue-name` - Urgent fixes

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/improve-disk-space-handling
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test locally**
   ```powershell
   # Test with actual ISO
   .\scripts\tiny11maker-headless.ps1 -ISO E -INDEX 1 -SkipCleanup
   
   # Verify ISO boots in VM
   # Check removed components
   # Validate checksums
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add disk space pre-flight check
   
   - Check available space before build
   - Throw error if insufficient
   - Suggest alternative scratch drive"
   ```

5. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/improve-disk-space-handling
   ```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### What to Test

Since builds take 40+ minutes, focus testing on:

1. **Parameter validation**
   - Invalid drive letters
   - Out-of-range image indices
   - Missing ISO files

2. **Error handling**
   - Insufficient disk space
   - Missing prerequisites
   - Network failures

3. **Output verification**
   - ISO file exists
   - Checksums are valid
   - File size is reasonable

### Local Testing Checklist

Before submitting a PR:

- [ ] Script runs without errors
- [ ] Generated ISO boots in VM (VirtualBox/Hyper-V)
- [ ] Removed components are actually removed
- [ ] Registry tweaks are applied
- [ ] Checksums are generated correctly
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality

### VM Testing (Recommended)

```powershell
# Quick VM test script
$isoPath = ".\tiny11.iso"

# Create new VM in Hyper-V
New-VM -Name "Tiny11-Test" -MemoryStartupBytes 2GB -Generation 2

# Attach ISO
Set-VMDvdDrive -VMName "Tiny11-Test" -Path $isoPath

# Boot and verify
Start-VM -Name "Tiny11-Test"
```
